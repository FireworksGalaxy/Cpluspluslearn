Objects and variables represent memory locations that hold values. These values can be fetched on demand.

Point 2: For reasons that will become clear when we discuss operators in more detail, for operators that are symbols, it is common to append the operatorâ€™s symbol to the word operator.

For example, the plus operator would be written operator+, and the extraction operator would be written operator>>.


Oprator's Arity!
Unary= Minus 5= -5; This operation takes One operand!
Binary= Takes two operand! EX: 3+4; It takes from left and right! 

Ternary operators act on three operands. There is only one of these in C++ (the conditional operator).
Nullary operators act on zero operands. There is also only one of these in C++ (the throw operator).
