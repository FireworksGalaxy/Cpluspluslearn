- Header guard: 

When this header is #included, the preprocessor checks whether SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE has been previously defined.
If this is the first time weâ€™re including the header, SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE will not have been defined. Consequently, 
it #defines SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE and includes the contents of the file. If the header is included again into the same file,
SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE will already have been defined from the first time the contents of the header were included, 
and the contents of the header will be ignored (thanks to the #ifndef).

EXAMPLE:
#ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
#define SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE

// your declarations (and certain types of definitions) here

#endif
