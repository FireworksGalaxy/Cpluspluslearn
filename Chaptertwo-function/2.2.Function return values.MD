- The return value from main is sometimes called a status code (also sometimes called an exit code, or rarely a return code), as it is used to indicate whether the program ran successfully or not
By definition, a status code of 0 means the program executed successfully.

- The C++ standard only defines the meaning of 3 status codes: \textcolor{red}{red}0, EXIT_SUCCESS, and EXIT_FAILURE. 0 and EXIT_SUCCESS both mean the program executed successfully. 
\bold{EXIT_FAILURE} means the program did not execute successfully.
EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are preprocessor macros defined in the <cstdlib> header:

#include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE

int main()
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
If you want to maximize portability, you should only use 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS to indicate a successful termination, or EXIT_FAILURE to indicate an unsuccessful termination.
