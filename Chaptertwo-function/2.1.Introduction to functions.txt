- A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
- You already know that every executable program must have a function named main .
- Functions that you write yourself are called user-defined functions.
-The function initiating the function call is the caller, and the function being called is the callee or called function.

returnType functionName() // This is the function header (tells the compiler about the existence of the function)
{
    // This is the function body (tells the compiler what the function does)
}

- Any function can call any other function.

- Nested functions are not supported

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    void foo() // Illegal: this function is nested inside function main()
    {
        std::cout << "foo!\n";
    }

    foo(); // function call to foo()
    return 0;
}
