USING 3RD Party for the debugging:
An alternate approach to repeatedly adding/removing or uncommenting/commenting debug statements is to use a 3rd party library that will let you leave debug statements 
in your code but compile them out in release mode via a preprocessor macro.
dbg is one such header-only library that exists to help facilitate this (via the DBG_MACRO_DISABLE preprocessor macro).


NOTE:
std::cerr >> std::cout ==> in terms of operation

Tactics:
        -- Preprocessors Directives
        -- Using Plog/spdlog (3rd Party)
        --
