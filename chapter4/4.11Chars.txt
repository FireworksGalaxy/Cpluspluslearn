-- The char data type was designed to hold a single character. A character can be a single letter, number, symbol, or whitespace.

--  The char data type is an integral type, meaning the underlying value is stored as an integer.
    Similar to how a Boolean value 0 is interpreted as false and non-zero is interpreted as true,
    the integer stored by a char variable are intepreted as an ASCII character.

------------
char ch2{ 'a' }; // initialize with code point for 'a' (stored as integer 97) (preferred)
------------

-  Be careful not to mix up character numbers with integer numbers. The following two initializations are not the same:

    char ch{5}; // initialize with integer 5 (stored as integer 5)
    char ch{'5'}; // initialize with code point for '5' (stored as integer 53)

Make sure that your newlines are using escape sequence '\n' , not multicharacter literal '/n'.

\n is useful for us!
